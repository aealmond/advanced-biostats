# Submission Guidelines

## Submission Procedure
Please upload problem solutions to advanced-biostats/problem-sets/problem-set-X/submissions, where X indicates the problem set number. Do your best to upload your work close to the specified deadline as uploaded work is viewable by everyone in the class.

## File Type
All problem set solutions should be submitted as a single .R script unless otherwise indicated.

## Executability 
The .R script should be fully executable. That is, I should not have to download additional packages to run your script. All coding should be completed using the functions provided in base R unless otherwise indicated in the problem set.

## Annotations
Code must be annotated to demonstrate understanding. Multiple instances of the same coding technique/function/syntax need only be annotated once. All for/while loops, custom functions and conditional statements should be heavily annotated. Annotations should be offset using a single hash (#). The instructor will use triple hashes (###) to offset corrections.

## Format
### Header
The solutions to each problem set should include a header containing the problem set title and your full name.
### Problem Prompts
Problem prompts should be numbered in the .R script using double hashes (##). Separate problem should be offset by at least two line breaks.
