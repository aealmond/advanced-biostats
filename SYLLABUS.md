### Course Description

Given the breadth of inferential techniques used in modern biological research, it has become increasingly important for scientists to maintain a high degree of statistical literacy. This course builds on the fundamental principles taught in introductory statistics courses, and offers practical insight into three of the most commonly applied modeling frameworks in contemporary literature: (1) linear and generalized linear modeling, (2) multivariate ordination, and (3) Bayesian analysis. These three concepts will structure the course schedule following a brief introduction to probability distributions, and the statistical programming language, R. To prioritize statistical application and interpretation, the course will rely heavily on R-based, in-class exercises, weekly take-hone problem sets, and methods-focused paper discussions.

### Modes of Evaluation

**1. Problem Sets**

   Problem sets will be assigned weekly on Tuesdays, focusing on recently discussed and demonstrated topics and techniques. Submission of your completed work, in the form of an annotated .R document (see [Homework Formatting & Submission](###Homework Formatting & Submission) for more details), should be made to the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/sdmason/advanced-biostats) no later than 12:00pm on the following Tuesday. Any problem set can be revised and resubmitted to GitHub within one week of recieving the graded first attempt. Revised work is eligible for up to 75% of the original point value. For example, if a particular problem is marked 3/10, a perfect revision would earn the statistician a 7.5/10. It follows then that, aside from personal edification, revising problems marked >= 0.75 confers no additional academic benefit. Problem sets should initially be completed independently; however, I encourage you to seek the help of your peers when rivising a problem set! And, of course, you are always welcome to discuss problem sets with me at any time.

**2. Paper Discussions**

   We will dedicate the first half of every other Thursday class to discussing the statistical methods employed in published literature. Statisticians should arrive to class having read the paper (with particular gusto in the methods and results sections), and prepared to contribute at least three questions/answers/critiques to the discussion. These sessions will be graded based on participation. If a statistician should feel uncomfortable in this type of environment, they are invited to engage in a spirited email exchange with me for full credit prior to the in-class discussion.

**3. Final Exam**

   The final exam will take the form of an extended, comprehensive problem set, to be submitted to the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/sdmason/advanced-biostats) at the beginning of the scheduled exam period. Statisticians will be given two weeks to independently complete the exam.

**4. Methods Replication Project (Undergraduate)**

   Undergraduate members of the class will, in pairs, be assigned a peer-reviewed journal article and asked to reproduce the statistical methods as faithfully as possible. Their efforts will be shared with the class in a 20 minute presentation, structured and graded according to the [Methods Replication Project Rubric](https://github.com/sdmason/advanced-biostats/blob/master/resources/mrp-rubric.md).

**5. In-class Lecture and Exercise (Graduate)**

   Graduate members of the class will, in pairs, select a statistical topic, not covered by this course, to teach to their peers. Statisticians should prepare a ~30 minute lecture and ~50 minute complimentary R-based exercise. Suitable topics will vary broadly; here are a few that I find interesting, though selections can be made from outside of this list:

   * Data Visualization
   * Time-to-Event Analysis
   * Tree-Based Modeling
   * Data-Mining & Acquisition
   * Path Analysis
   * Bayesian Modeling in STAN
   * Analysis of Citizen Science Data
